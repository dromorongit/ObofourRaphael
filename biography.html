                <div class="bio-text">
                    <p>Silvanus Raphael Oduro Dickson, popularly known as Obofour Raphael, was born on April 10th in Brescia, in the Lombardy region of Italy. Although born abroad, he was raised in Dansoman, Accra, Ghana, where his passion for music was nurtured alongside his educational journey. Obofour Raphael began his primary education at Ave Maria School and later attended Opoku Ware Secondary School. He is currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at the University of Staffordshire in the United Kingdom.</p>

                    <p>From a young age, Obofour Raphael discovered his talent for rap and actively participated in rap battles within his community. In 2003, he formed his first music group, Akasafour (which translates to Communicators), alongside his elder brother. Together, they recorded their first demo tape, marking the beginning of his professional music journey. The group later parted ways when his brother stepped away from music, while Obofour Raphael chose to continue, driven by his unwavering passion for the craft.</p>

                    <p>As a solo artist, he released several popular tracks that enjoyed significant airplay, including "Konkonsa (Telephone No Wire)" featuring Scooby Selah of Th4Kwages, "Kyakya", "Megye Me Sika", "Gye Wo Kawa", "Asem Yi Di Ka", "Obaa", "Yesu", and others.
